I have uploaded tagUI source from MacOS. You need to run following command for TagUI

tagui/src/tagui mydicer.tag

Please see mydicer.tag file which has commands to login and search dice without writing any code

If this command is not running, try uploading windows version of TagUI from https://tagui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html and follow instructions
